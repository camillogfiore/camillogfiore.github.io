# Camillo Fiore

Hi there!

I'm doing my PhD in Philosophy at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), with a scholarship from the Argentinian CONICET. 
You can check some of my [writings](/writings). Also, you can download my (hopefully up-to-date) [CV](/camillofiorecv.pdf).

I specialize in philosophical logic. Currently, I focus mostly on substructural logics, theories of truth, and the identity criteria for logical systems. I am part of the [Buenos Aires Logic Group](https://ba-logic.com/). Also, since 2020 I've been a teaching assistant in logic at UBA.
